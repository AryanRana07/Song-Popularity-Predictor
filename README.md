# Song-Popularity-Predictor
This project leverages machine learning to assess the popularity of 1000 K-pop tracks. It examines factors like song duration, explicit content, release date, and overall popularity, aiming to uncover trends and insights driving the success of K-pop songs.

### Description
In my K-pop songs analysis project, I harnessed my data science expertise to conduct a comprehensive exploration of a dataset featuring diverse song features. Initially, I meticulously cleaned the data, addressing inconsistencies and missing values. Employing advanced feature engineering techniques, I enhanced the dataset's dimensionality, ensuring a rich analytical foundation. Following this, I adeptly applied preprocessing methods to prepare the data for analysis. Utilizing prominent Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn, I delved into both supervised and unsupervised machine learning realms. For supervised learning, I utilized decision tree algorithms, while in the unsupervised domain, K-means clustering emerged as the method of choice.

With the application of these algorithms, I generated insightful visualizations, offering a nuanced understanding of the dataset's underlying patterns. To objectively compare the performance of the algorithms, I leveraged silhouette scores, employing them as a benchmark to determine the superior approach. This meticulous comparative analysis allowed me to identify the most effective algorithm for the given dataset, showcasing my analytical acumen and proficiency in machine learning techniques.
